# Customer_Churn_Analysis
Analyzes a Telco dataset to predict customer churn, covering data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, and feature engineering. It uses a Random Forest model for prediction and evaluates performance with classification metrics.

Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

<b>Data Loading and Exploration:</b> It loads necessary libraries and the dataset, and conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize the data and examine churn distribution.

<b>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:</b> Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.

<b>Visualization:</b> Includes visualizations to explore relationships between churn and other variables, such as tenure and monthly charges.

<b>Feature Selection and Model Building:</b> Implements a Random Forest model to predict customer churn, with feature selection and scaling.

<b>Model Evaluation:</b> Evaluates model performance using classification metrics and a confusion matrix.
